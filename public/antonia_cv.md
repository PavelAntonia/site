## Summary

From Monday to Friday, I’m an HRIS Analyst and technical problem solver, keeping HR systems reliable and turning business requirements into concrete, scalable technical actions. I operate at the intersection of data, systems, and people, fixing what breaks and optimizing what can work better. Outside of work, I recharge by reading, traveling, and staying active, currently training for a half marathon, which means I have stamina for both long runs and long problem solving sessions. I enjoy building things that last, whether it’s robust system logic or the endurance to cross the finish line.

## Experience

**Analyst, Systems and Automation (HRIS)**
SES Satellites, Luxembourg | Jun 2022 - Present

* **Intelsat integration:** Supported end to end integration of Intelsat employees into HR systems, ensuring SAP data migration, interface synchronization, and accurate employee master data across platforms. Developed validation scripts for employee data and org structure, enabling the new org structure to be implemented in under one day.
* **Large scale reorganizations:** Supported multiple reorganizations impacting 2,000+ employees by technically validating proposed org structures, implementing changes in HR systems (SAP ECC, SAP SuccessFactors), and coordinating with IT and Finance to ensure downstream readiness and data consistency.
* **Org chart automation (CLI):** Built a CLI tool that generates org charts, saving ~40 hours per quarter in standard operations and 50+ hours per major reorg. Implemented Python (pandas) data wrangling from Excel/CSV inputs, produced JSON payloads, and generated a static HTML output rendering org charts using D3.js.
* **Employee document migration to DMS:** Migrated 20,000+ employee documents for 1,500+ employees from shared drives and Docova into a DMS, resolving missing or incorrect metadata, mapping files to the approved taxonomy, improving mass upload process.
* **System operations:** Owned end to end HR systems operations, ensuring stability, data integrity, and smooth day to day performance across core HR platforms. Built reporting and analytics dashboards in Power BI to support HR and business decisions. Led configuration, upgrades, and process improvements by translating HR requirements into scalable technical implementations.
* **Automation:** Developed scripts to automate data cleaning, transformation, deduplication, validation, and integration pipelines, reducing manual processing time by hours per cycle and eliminating error-prone manual workflows.



**Corporate Services Transformation**
KPMG, Madrid | Jan 2022 - Jun 2022

* Drove treasury process transformation for a global client, mapping and centralizing cash flow, risk management, forecasting, and financial reporting across Benelux.
* Led stakeholder interviews and workshops to capture business requirements, pain points, and regional variations, aligning teams on a single process vision.
* Delivered end to end process documentation (As Is, To Be), governance (RACI), controls considerations, and an implementation roadmap, reducing process fragmentation and enabling a single, scalable operating model.


**Research Assistant**
EELISA European University, Remote from Finland | Sep 2021 - Nov 2021

* Built ya2ro. Given a YAML file with identifiers (DOIs, ORCIDs, code repository URLs) and basic description (summary, title) as input to the tool, ya2ro will collect existing metadata from external APIs and generate a Research Object.
* Provides both human readable HTML and machine readable JSON-LD outputs, aligned to Schema.org terms, enabling reuse and interoperability across tools.
* Packaged and published the tool as open source, with distribution and documentation via GitHub and PyPI for easy adoption by researchers.
* [Publication: “Ya2ro: A tool for creating Research Objects from minimum metadata”](https://dgarijo.com/papers/Ya2RO_Damalos_2023_DEMO.pdf)

**Software Engineer (Intern)**
Vector ITC Group / Santander Bank, Madrid | Jun 2019 - Jul 2019
